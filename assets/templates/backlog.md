# {{ROLE_NAME_UPPER}} Execution Backlog

This file is the authoritative execution ledger for `{{ROLE_ID}}`. The matching planner and executor may update it across runs. Other roles must not write it.

## Lifecycle contract

- The planner creates one work order and appends its backlog entry in the same repository change. A `ready` work order is immutable; a `needs_input` draft may be revised only to apply its recorded resolution before becoming `ready`.
- The executor claims work by changing `ready` → `in_progress`, incrementing the attempt, and replacing `none` with a stable claim identifier.
- The executor must persist the claim before modifying product files. If the claim cannot be established from current durable repository state, stop without implementation.
- A successful executor changes `in_progress` → `completed` only after verification passes.
- A missing dependency changes `in_progress` → `blocked`, resets the Claim to `none`, and records evidence without closing the work.
- A permission-sensitive question changes `in_progress` → `needs_input`, resets the Claim to `none`, preserves the exact question, and pauses for manual intervention.
- `blocked` and `needs_input` are recoverable. After durable resolution evidence is recorded, an authorized role-local update may return the entry to `ready` for another claimed attempt.
- `completed` and `cancelled` are terminal. Never return a terminal entry to `ready` under the same work-order ID.
- If a resolution requires different scope or ownership, explicitly cancel the old entry only after enqueueing a replacement work order that references it.
- Preserve terminal entries as history.
- This backlog owns lifecycle state. Work orders own scope and acceptance criteria; status files summarize evidence.

## Recovery contract

- Ask first when a human decision could authorize safe continuation.
- If interactive input is available, ask the exact question and wait.
- If interactive input is unavailable, persist the exact question in the entry's Result, set the state to `needs_input`, reset the Claim to `none`, and pause.
- Work in `needs_input` must not be marked `completed` or `cancelled` merely because no answer is immediately available.
- Work in `blocked` must name the missing dependency and the evidence required to return it to `ready`.
- A planner may perform a recovery review when new durable resolution evidence exists. It must resolve the existing entry instead of stacking unrelated work.
- Never infer that an unresolved claim is abandoned from elapsed time alone.
